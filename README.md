# Example Redux to Context API

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application shows how to transition from [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

It's bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What it does

It's a simple shopping cart. There is a list of products provided by an asynchronous call (mocked to keep it simple). The products can be added to a cart, which updates the cart, the price per product and the total product.

Additionally, you can swith the theme using the toggle button in the navigation bar.

## Getting Started

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Runs all the tests, based on [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/).
